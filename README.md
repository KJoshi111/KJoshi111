## Hello Viewer

Thank you for your interest and time for visitng my GitHub page. I am Kiran Dave [MSc in Statistics - Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, India].

I have acquired experience and skills by working in different countries and in various fields. I recently moved to the USA with my family and I am looking to change my career path. I like to deal with people and data. With my education in Statistics, I can surely be a beneficial addition to any team.
For refreshing up my knowledge and skills I recently joined and completed the Data Analytics Bootcamp from University of California (Davis). Some projects I did while attending the bootcamp are in my GitHub page. Please take a look and if you have any suggestions for my GitHub page, feel free to reach me at davekiran@gmail.com

Thanks,
Kiran Dave.
Folsom, California.
